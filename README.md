$253$. Meeting Rooms II  
https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/  
The core of this problem is to keep track of the earliest end time of currently in-use conference rooms, since if a meeting starts before it, then an additional conference room is necessarily needed. Therefore, we just need to go through all intervals in the ascending order of their start times. If a start time is less than current earliest end time, it means we need an additional room; if the start time is larger, the meeting in the room with earliest end time is already over, current meeting can occupy the room, and we update the earliest end time accordingly. Either a priority queue or an array with a pointer can update the earliest end time correctly. Since sorting is involved, we need $O(N\log N)$ time; since we need to remember end times to update the earliest one, we need $O(N)$.
  
  
$291$. Word Pattern II  
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/  
This is a straightforward backtracking problem. In each recursion, if current character does not match to any string, match it to every prefix of remaining s and try if such match works, and stop when one works; if current character already matches to a string, check if the string is the following string in s and backtrack if it is not. Suppose the length of pattern is $m$ and that of s is $n$. The search process resembles placing m sticks among n objects, so the time and space complexity is $n\choose m$.
